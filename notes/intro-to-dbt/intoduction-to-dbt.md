1. What is DBT?
  - Is an acronym for Data Build Tools, which performs the `T`- transformation in ELT, using SQL like syntax to create models and staging tables. 

  ## ETL vs ELT
     - ETL (Extract Transform Load) - Back in the days, storage was not cheap, developers had to `Extract` and `transform` raw data on the fly before `loading`/save the clean version od the data to warehouse.

     - ELT (Extract Load Transform) - Now are days, storage is cheap. I mean a cup of coffee can buy gigs. Since storage is affordable, developers adopted a new way of ingesting data, which is `Extract` raw data, Load to a warehouse then `transform` the data into usable/insightful data. This depicts the modern data acrchitecture `medallion architecture -   (Bronze, silver, gold)`
